# ResistanceCalculator
ResistanceCalculator is a simple program that calculates the equivalent resistance of a circuit composed of resistors connected in series or parallel. It takes the values of the individual resistors as input and outputs the total resistance of the circuit. The program is written in C++ and uses basic concepts of electricity and Ohm's law.
